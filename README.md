# bulk-list-pdf-metadata

Reads PDF documents' metadata and outputs filename with title if the latter is present.

## Init

- create folder "files"
- paste PDF files into it
- put pdf filenames into the array (see below) in index.html (path ("files") gets added automatically, so you need only the filenames!)
- open index.html (via http) in browser

```javascript
var urls = [
	'' //filenames go here, one each line.
];
```
